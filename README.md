A small (and at the moment - very basic) web app that I'm working on to learn 
more about the [Iron](http://ironframework.io/) framework 
https://github.com/iron/iron which is **Awesome** and written in 
the [Rust programming language](http://www.rust-lang.org/)

So far this is simply a reworking of the [staticfile example](https://github.com/iron/staticfile).
